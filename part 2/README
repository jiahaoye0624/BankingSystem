-- In program 2, there are 2 main files:
-- p2.java
-- p2.sql

-- p2.java
-- Implementation file of the P2 class.
-- It is CLI for the self service bank.
-- Instead of using BankingSystem.java like p1.java, I move all the database connection code into p2.java
-- Moreover, p2.java call STP rather than using JDBC queries.
-- It fulfills all the requirement from the program description.
        
        -- Things to remind: The program will ask for "Input anything to Continue...."
        -- Usage: input any character and hit enter will process.
        
        -- The purpose is a buffer and let client has their own time to remember the information that they need, 
        -- such as Customer ID and Account Number.
        -- Moreover, the program will return success or fail once the operation processed.
-- Usage for p2.java:
        -- java -cp ";./db2jcc4.jar" p2 db.properties

-- p2.sql
-- Implementation file of the p2 sql procedures
-- 7 procedures followed the project description
-- There is an extra procedure call ACCT_IDT.
        -- ACCT_IDT is an account identity check. 
        -- To check the account belongs to the customer or not.
